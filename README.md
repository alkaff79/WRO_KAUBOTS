Two robots for WRO competition organized by Saudi Games

It's been a month since participating in the WRO competition organized by Saudi Games &The Saudi Federation for Robotics & RC Sports! It was a challenging experience filled with various problems. In summary, the competition was about pushing ping pong balls into the opponent's field within two minutes. Typically, each team designs two robots to track the balls and hit them towards the opponent. However, our team thought outside the box and used air to propel and move the balls with a constant motion! ðŸ’¨ âš¾
We analyzed the situation and found that jet engines would be the best choice to execute that idea. To apply this, we studied some concepts in aeronautical engineering, like Bernoulli's principle, and others essential in drones that make the engine work.
We passed the initial qualifiers at the Western region level without any losses or ties. We reached the group stage also without any losses or ties and secured the first position in the group. Unfortunately, in the final qualifiers, we were eliminated in the first match due to a technical malfunction in one of the robots, which affected its functionality.
We're excited about the upcoming competitions!

All thanks to my teammates Raed Saidi and Ahmed Alsaggaf, I've never dealt with such a cohesive team before and also the team coach ENG.Raid Al-tamimi.
